# NSSP_Mini_Project_1_Group_M

For this project we used a dataset of participants that listened to positive versus negative emotional musical and nonemotional - nonmusical stimuli during fMRI scanning. 
Our goal was to determine which brain region is activated according to the stimuli mentioned before. For simplicity we focused only on the control subject number 1. We preprocessed the anatomical and functional data in order to do a kMeans analysis and find relevant brain networks.
